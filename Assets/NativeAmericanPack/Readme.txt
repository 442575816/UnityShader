FPS village: Native American Pack
=================================

Thanks for your support!

Find all prefabs configured and ready to use at their designated folder! By default, all prefabs are set to static with the exeptions of:
 - Individual barrel models (rigidbodies)
 - All 8 pots (rigidbodies)
 - Hanging artifact (rigidbody with a hinge joint)

Post-processing:
 1) Use linear color space
 2) Have your camera render using deferred path (HDR on, no MSAA)
 3) Have your camera on the same layer as the Post-process volume GameObject
 

Happy game developing!
